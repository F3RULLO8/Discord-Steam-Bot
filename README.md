# Discord-Steam-Bot

This is a Discord Bot that will respond back with some information about the Steam Profile you pinged with.

It uses REST API calls to get profile information using the public Steam API. It will then process the JSON responses to legible data.

Then we create a discord bot that will listens for the specific formatted message and calls the Steam API function. It then responds with an embed message with the processed data.
